# Appendix {-}

The following table of selected sentinel anomalies indicate the trends in congenital anomaly prevalence in Nova Scotia from 1987 through 2021. Sentinel anomalies are those which the International Clearinghouse of Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR), of which we are a member, watches worldwide with the rationale that they are quite easily identified hence more accurately reported. *See Appendix A.5 (p. 53) for other anomalies listed in the report.*
