Overall, the prevalence rates have decreased over the past 10 years - 2012-2021: $\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ -0.13, p-value = < 0.0001). The $95\%$ for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ is given by CI:[-0.18; -0.07].

<p class="caption">(\#fig:nt3)Neural tube defects - Nova Scotia.</p>
</div>


Figure \@ref(fig:nt3) shows how the prevalence of neural tube defects is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.

Neural tube defects appear to be more prevalent in western counties, although 3 counties (Digby, Queens and Shelburne) reported no data on this anomaly in the 2000-2010 period. Richmond is another county that showed consistently high values of prevalence over the years.

Guysborough is the only county where neural tube defects have never been reported.

### Selected central nervous system {#section-23}

At a $5\%$ level, there is a decreasing trend with selected central nervous system.

</div>


Overall, the prevalence rates have decreased over the past 10 years - 2012-2021: $\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ -0.08, p-value = < 0.0001). The $95\%$ for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ is given by CI:[-0.12; -0.04] .

<p class="caption">(\#fig:cns3)Selected central nervous system - Nova Scotia.</p>
</div>


Figure \@ref(fig:cns3) shows how the prevalence of selected congenital nervous system is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.

Selected congenital nervous system appear to be more prevalent in western counties, with the highest values for prevalence happening between 1988-2010, especially for Kings and the Annapolis counties.

### Selected sense organ defects {#section-24}

At a $5\%$ level, there is no significant trend with selected sense organ defects ($\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ 0.01, $p-value=$ 0.14), even though rates appear to be increasing slightly.

</div>


Overall, the prevalence rates have decreased over the past 10 years - 2012-2021: $\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ -0.08, p-value = < 0.0001). The $95\%$ for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ is given by CI:[-0.12; -0.04].

</div>


Figure \@ref(fig:sod3) shows how the prevalence of selected sense organ defects is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.

Selected sense organ defects appear to be more prevalent in Richmond county.

Overall, the prevalence rates have decreased over the past 10 years - 2012-2021: $\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ -0.08, p-value = < 0.0001). The $95\%$ for $\hat{\beta_{1}}$ is given by CI:[-0.12; -0.04].

Figure \@ref(fig:chd3) shows how the prevalence of congenital heart defects is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.

Congenital heart defects appear to be more prevalent in Richmond county.

Digby is the only county where selected sense organ defects have never been reported.
