### Neural tube defects {#section-22}

At a $5\%$ level, there is no significant trend with neural tube defects as a whole or within the sub-group encephalocele.

At a $5\%$ level, it was possible to see a slightly increasing and decreasing trend for anencephaly ($\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ 0.02, $p-value=$ 0.04), and spina bifida ($\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ -0.02, $p-value=$ 0.01), respectively.

Overall, the prevalence rates have decreased over the past 10 years (2012-2021: $\hat{\beta_{1}} =$ -0.11, p-value = 0.01); $95\%$ CI:[-0.18; -0.05])
