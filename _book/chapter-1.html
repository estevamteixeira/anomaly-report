<h4>Neural tube defects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#neural-tube-defects"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Anencephaly and similar malformations (Q00) -</strong> partial or complete absence of the brain and skull.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Encephalocele (Q01) -</strong> herniation of brain tissue and/or meninges through a defect in the skull. The hernia sac is usually covered by skin.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spina bifida (Q05, Q76.0) -</strong> incomplete closure of the vertebral spine (usually posteriorly) through which spinal cord tissue and/or the membranes covering the spine (meninges) herniate.</p></li>

</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microcephaly (Q02) -</strong> microcephaly, or microcephalus, is the clinical finding of a small head when compared with infants of the same sex and age. The head circumference (HC), also known as the occipitofrontal circumference (OFC), is considered a reliable assessment of the volume of the underlying brain. Microcephaly itself is not a malformation but a sign that the brain is abnormally small.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Congenital hydrocephalus (Q03) -</strong> an increase in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain resulting in enlargement of the cerebral ventricles and increased intracranial pressure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arhinencephaly/Holoprosencephaly (Q04.1, Q04.2)</strong> arhinencephaly is an older term for holoprosencephaly which refers more specifically to structural defects of the olfactory system or nose. Holoprosencephaly results from variable degrees of incomplete division of the brain into right and left cerebral hemispheres. There are four types which vary in severity: alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle interhemisphereic (MIHV). The condition can also affect development of the face and eyes. The most severely affected have one central eye (cyclopia) and a single tubular-shaped nose located above the eye (proboscis).</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p><strong>Anophtalmos/Microphtalmos (Q11.0, Q11.1, Q11.2) -</strong> anophthalmia – Total absence of eye tissue or apparent absence of the globe of the eye in an otherwise normal orbit. Microphthalmia – Reduced volume of the eye. The corneal diameter is usually less than 10 millimeters, or the anteroposterior globe diameter is less than 20 millimeters. Anophthalmia or microphthalmia may affect one or both eyes, or there may be anophthalmia of one eye and microphthalmia of the other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anotia/Microtia (Q16.0/Q17.2) -</strong> anotia - Total absence of the external ear and canal. Microtia - Malformation or hypoplasia of the external ear (auricle, pinna).</p></li>

<h4>Selected congenital heart defects<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#selected-congenital-heart-defects"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Commom truncus (Q20.0) -</strong> failure of separation of the aorta and the pulmonary artery during development, resulting in a single common arterial trunk carrying blood from the heart to both the body and lungs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discordant ventriculoarterial connection (Q20.30, Q20.31, Q20.32, Q20.38) -</strong> transposition of the aorta and the pulmonary artery such that the aorta arises from the right ventricle (instead of the left) and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle (instead of the right).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Atrioventricular septal defect (Q21.2) -</strong> a defect in both the lower portion of the atrial septum and the upper portion of the ventricular septum. In extreme cases, virtually the entire atrial and ventricular septae may be missing. The valves controlling blood flow from the atria to the ventricles, the tricuspid and mitral valves may also be abnormal. They may not form from the endocardial cushions during cardiac development into two separate valves, and thus be a single common atrioventricular valve. Together, these defects producing a large opening (canal) in the central part of the heart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tetralogy of Fallot (Q21.3) -</strong> congenital obstruction of the opening of the nasal cavity into the nasopharynx on either side. This prevents communication of the nasal cavity with the pharynx.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (Q23.4) -</strong> a condition in which the structures on the left side of the heart and the aorta are extremely small, insufficient to support systemic circulation and with normally related great arteries. Classically, this condition includes hypoplasia of the left ventricle, atresia or severe hypoplasia of both the mistral and aortic valves, hypoplasia of the aortic arch, and coarctation of the aorta.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coarctation of aorta (Q25.1) -</strong> narrowing of the descending aorta, which may obstruct blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. The most common site of coarctation occurs distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery in the region of the ductus arteriosus. If there is complete loss of communication in this location, it is a form of interruption of the aorta (Type A).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Small intestine absence/atresia/stenosis (Q41) -</strong> complete or partial occlusion of the lumen of one or more segments of the small intestine. Small intestinal atresias are often assigned a type descriptor in the surgical or autopsy report, depending upon the severity of the atresia (types include I, II, IIIA, IIIB, and VI).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ano-rectal absence/atresia/stenosis (Q42.0-Q42.3) -</strong> complete or partial occlusion of the lumen of one or more segments of the large intestine and/or rectum.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lower urinary tract obstruction (Q64.2, Q64.3) -</strong> posterior urethral valves (PUV) are tissue folds of the posterior urethra and function as valves obstructing urine outflow. Congenital PUV is an abnormal congenital obstructing membrane that is located within the posterior male urethra; this valve is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male children. Congenital PUV can also be found in virilized females and rarely in normal females. Obstruction could vary from mild to severe.</p></li>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter-1.html#fig:nt3">1.3</a> shows how the prevalence of neural tube defects is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.</p>
<p>Neural tube defects appear to be more prevalent in western counties, although 3 counties (Digby, Queens and Shelburne) reported no data on this anomaly in the 2000-2010 period. Richmond is another county that showed consistently high values of prevalence over the years.</p>
<p>Guysborough is the only county where neural tube defects have never been reported.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter-1.html#fig:cns3">1.6</a> shows how the prevalence of selected congenital nervous system is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.</p>
<p>Selected congenital nervous system appear to be more prevalent in western counties, with the highest values for prevalence happening between 1988-2010, especially for Kings and the Annapolis counties.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter-1.html#fig:ldd3">1.28</a> shows how the prevalence of limb deficiency defects is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.</p>
<p>Limb deficiency defects appear to be more prevalent in the central (Hants county), western (Yarmouth county), and eastern zones (Inverness, Victoria, and Richmond).</p>
<p>Limb deficiency defects seem to be a rare anomaly since 7 (39%) counties have not reported any occurrences for the last period (11 years).</p>

<p>Figure <a href="chapter-1.html#fig:awd3">1.31</a> shows how the prevalence of selected abdominal wall defects is geographically distributed in Nova Scotia by county in 3 different periods.</p>
<p>Selected abdominal wall defects appear to be more prevalent in the western (Digby county), and northern zones (Pictou, Colchester, Cumberland counties).</p>
<p>Selected abdominal wall defects seem to be a rare anomaly since 9 (50%) counties have not reported any occurrences for the last period (11 years).</p>

<p>Selected chromosomal defects appear to be more present all over Nova Scotia with high prevalence in the following counties by zones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Northern: Cumberland, Antigonish counties.</p></li>
<li><p>Western: Digby, and Annapolis counties.</p></li>
